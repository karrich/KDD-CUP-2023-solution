# Co-occurrence matrix
When implementing it, we built a variety of different co-occurrence matrices.
# Single-hop recall
Suppose P(i,Â·) is the co-occurrence set of item `i` to other items in the cooccurrence matrix, then the recall formula is:

`W` is the weight, which is determined by the position of the item in the session.
# Multi-hop recall
The recall formula for multi-hop recall and single-hop recall is the same,
except that the matrix of multi-hop recall is generated from the matrix of single-hop recall:

# detail
We found that for a session, we want to predict the label, it must not have appeared in the session.
